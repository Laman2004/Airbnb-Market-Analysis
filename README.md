This project provides insights into the Airbnb market in New York City, focusing on the relationship between neighborhood distribution and average nightly prices. The dashboard was created using Tableau Public.

## Dashboard Components
### Neighborhood Distribution with Revenue Insights (Map)

Each dot represents an Airbnb listing location.

Colors indicate different neighborhoods.

Shows the geographical spread of listings and highlights areas with dense Airbnb activity.

### Average Price per Night by Neighborhood Group (Bar Chart)

Compares average nightly prices across the five NYC boroughs.

Key Findings:

Manhattan has the highest average nightly price.

Brooklyn ranks second but is significantly cheaper than Manhattan.

Queens shows moderate pricing.

Bronx and Staten Island have the lowest average nightly prices.

⚠️ Note: The price values appear unusually large (e.g., Manhattan > 1,000,000). This may be due to data aggregation errors or extreme outliers in the dataset. A data-cleaning step is recommended.

## Insights

Location drives pricing: Central and tourist-heavy areas like Manhattan command higher prices.

Alternative affordability: Bronx and Staten Island offer more budget-friendly stays.

Market segmentation: Brooklyn balances between affordability and central accessibility, making it a popular choice.

## Tools Used

Tableau Public for visualization.

Airbnb NYC dataset (commonly used Kaggle dataset or similar source).

## Next Steps

Clean outliers to ensure realistic average price analysis.

Add filters (e.g., room type, availability, number of reviews).

Explore seasonal trends and revenue potential by borough.
